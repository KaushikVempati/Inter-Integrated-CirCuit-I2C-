# Inter-Integrated-CirCuit-I2C- design using Verilog and Verification of I2C using system verilog.
I2C protocol is a serial communication protocol that is used to connect low-speed devices. For example, EEPROMs, microcontrollers, A/D and D/A converters, and input/output interfaces.


It is a master-slave communication in which you can connect and control multiple slaves from a single master. In this, each slave device has a particular address. It supports various data rates according to versions ranging from 100 Kbps, 400 Kbps, 1 Mbps to 3.4 Mbps. It is synchronous communication like SPI.


I2C protocol uses only two cables for the communication in which one cable is used for the data (SDA), and another cable is used for clock (SCL). Both cables are required to pull up with a resistor for + Vdd. It can be used to link two I2C buses with different voltages.
